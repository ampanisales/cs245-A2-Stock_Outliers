I did opportunity 2, which involves creating a program with better outlier detection. I used the mean and standard deviation method
to find outliers; however, instead of having the outliers be values that are past 3 standard deviations from the mean, which is the
default for this method, I had the outliers be values that are past 2 standard deviations. In order to find the mean, I added up all
of the closing stock prices that were found in the records that were in the proper date range and then divided that sum by the number 
of records that were in range. In order to find the standard deviation, I had to first find the variance, becuase the standard deviation
is the square root of the variance. There is a method in OutlierDetector.java that calculates the variance, and the numbers needed for
that method are found when a new OutlierDetector object is created. The specific numbers I needed were the sum of the squares of the 
difference of the closing stock prices and the mean, and the number of records in range. Because this program deals with samples of data,
the formula found in the variance forumula uses n-1, instead of just n.
